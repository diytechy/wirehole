Create the override directory
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service.d

📌 Create the override file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service.d/override.conf

Paste your content:
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd-wait-online -i eth0


The first ExecStart= line clears the original command (required by systemd).
The second line sets your replacement.

📌 Reload systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload



📌 Optional: verify the override is active
systemctl cat systemd-networkd-wait-online.service


You should see your override appended at the bottom.

🧠 Why this fixes WSL freezing
WSL often hangs when systemd-networkd-wait-online waits for interfaces that don’t exist or never reach “online” state.
Using -i eth0 forces it to wait only for the WSL virtual NIC, preventing long boot delays.
This matches the behavior described in Linux documentation and community reports about wait-online timeouts.

If you want, I can also show you how to disable the service entirely, or how to detect the correct interface name inside WSL automatically.
